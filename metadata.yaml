description: "Dear Enemy is the sequel to Jean Webster's novel Daddy-Long-Legs. First\
  \ published in 1915, it was among the top ten best sellers in the US in 1916. The\
  \ story is presented in a series of letters written by Sallie McBride, Judy Abbott's\
  \ classmate and best friend in Daddy-Long-Legs. Among the recipients of the letters\
  \ are Judy; Jervis Pendleton, Judy's husband and the president of the orphanage\
  \ where Sallie is filling in until a new superintendent can be installed; Gordon\
  \ Hallock, a wealthy Congressman and Sallie's later fianc√©; and the orphanage's\
  \ doctor, embittered Scotsman Robin 'Sandy' MacRae (to whom Sallie addresses her\
  \ letters: \"Dear Enemy\"). Webster employs the epistolary structure to good effect;\
  \ Sallie's choices of what to recount to each of her correspondents reveal a lot\
  \ about her relationships with them.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
